# CLIK-Franka-Panda
A Franka Emika Panda model is used within the Gazebo simulation environment and three methods of Closed-Loop Inverse Kinematics (CLIK) are implemented using the Pinocchio library.
These methods are: 1. Jacobian transpose method; 2. Pseudoinverse method; 3. Damped least squares method.
